.. _Release Notes_7.50.0_Upgrade Notes:

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- The `win32_event_log check <https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/win32_event_log/?tab=events>`_
  has moved from Python `(integrations-core#16108) <https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/pull/16108>`_
  to Go `(#20701 <https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/20701>)`_.
  All ``legacy_mode: false`` configuration options are backwards compatible except for some regular expressions
  used in the ``included_messages`` and ``excluded_messages`` options.
  For example, Go regular expressions do not support lookahead or lookbehind assertions. If you do not
  use these options, then no configuration changes are necessary.
  See the `Python regular expression docs <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`_ and the
  `Go regular expression docs <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>`_ for more information on
  the supported regular expression syntax.
  Set ``legacy_mode_v2: true`` to revert to the Python implementation of the check. The Python implementation
  may be removed in a future version of the Agent.


.. _Release Notes_7.50.0_New Features:

New Features
------------

- The orchestrator check is moving from the Process Agent to the Node Agent. In the next release, this new check will replace the current pod check in the Process Agent. You can start using this new check now by manually setting the environment variable ``DD_ORCHESTRATOR_EXPLORER_RUN_ON_NODE_AGENT`` to ``true``.

- Adds the following CPU manager metrics to the kubelet core check: `kubernetes_core.kubelet.cpu_manager.pinning_errors_total`, `kubernetes_core.kubelet.cpu_manager.pinning_requests_total`.

- Add a diagnosis for connecting to the agent logs endpoints. This is accessible through the ``agent diagnose`` command.

- Add FIPS mode support for Network Device Monitoring products

- Added support for collecting Cloud Foundry container names without the Cluster Agent.

- The Kubernetes State Metrics Core check now collects `kubernetes_state.ingress.tls`.

- APM: Added a new endpoint tracer_flare/v1/. This endpoint acts as a 
  proxy to forward HTTP POST request from tracers to the serverless_flare 
  endpoint, allowing tracer flares to be triggered via remote config, improving
  the support experience by automating the collection of logs.

- CWS: Ability to send a signal to a process when a rule was triggered.
  CWS: Add Kubernetes user session context to events, in particular the username, UID and groups of the user that ran the commands remotely.

- Enable container image collection by default.

- Enable container lifecycle events collection by default.
  This feature helps stopped containers to be cleaned from Datadog faster.

- [netflow] Allow collecting configurable fields for Netflow V9/IPFIX

- Add support for Oracle 12.1 and Oracle 11.

- Add monitoring of Oracle ASM disk groups.

- Add metrics for monitoring Oracle resource manager.

- [corechecks/snmp] Load downloaded profiles

- DBM: Add configuration option to SQL obfuscator to use go-sqllexer package to run SQL obfuscation and normalization

- Support filtering metrics from endpoint and service checks based 
  on namespace when the `DD_CONTAINER_EXCLUDE_METRICS` environment
  variable is set.

- The Windows Event Log tailer saves its current position in an event log and
  resumes reading from that location when the Agent restarts. This allows
  the Agent to collect events created before the Agent starts.


.. _Release Notes_7.50.0_Enhancement Notes:

Enhancement Notes
-----------------

- [corechecks/snmp] Support symbol modifiers for global metric tags and metadata tags.

- Update the go-systemd package to the latest version (22.5.0).

- Added default peer tags for APM stats aggregation which can be enabled through a new flag (`peer_tags_aggregation`).

- Add a stop timeout to the Windows Agent services. If an Agent service
  does not cleanly stop within 15 seconds after receiving a stop command
  from the Service Control Manager, the service will hard stop.
  The timeout can be configured by setting the DD_WINDOWS_SERVICE_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
  environment variable.
  Agent stop timeouts are logged to the Windows Event Log and can be monitored and alerted on.

- APM: OTLP: Add support for custom container tags via resource attributes prefixed by `datadog.container.tag.*`.

- Agents are now built with Go ``1.20.11``.

- CWS: Support for Ubuntu 23.10.
  CWS: Reduce memory usage of ring buffer on machines with more than 64 CPU cores.
  CSPM: Move away from libapt to run Debian packages compliance checks.

- DBM: Bump the minimum version of the `go-sqllexer` library to 0.0.7 to support collecting stored procedure names.

- Add subcommand `diagnose show-metadata gohai` for gohai data

- Upgraded JMXFetch to ``0.49.0`` which adds some more telemetry
  and contains some small fixes.

- Netflow now supports the `datadog-agent status` command, providing
  configuration information. Any configuration errors encountered will be
  listed.

- Emit `database_instance` tag with the value `host/cdb`. The goal is to show each database separately in the DBM entry page. Currently, the backend initializes `database_instance` to `host`.
  Also, the Agent will emit the new `db_server` tag because we have to initialize the `host` tag to `host/cdb`.

- Improve obfuscator formatting. Prevent spaces after parentheses.
  Prevent spaces before `#` when `#` is a part of an identifier.

- Emit query metrics with zero executions to capture long runners spanning over several sampling periods.

- Impose a time limit on query metrics processing. After exceeding the default limit of 20s, the Agent stops emitting execution plans and fqt events.

- Add `oracle.inactive_seconds` metric. Add tags with session attributes to `oracle.process_pga*` metrics.

- Stop override peer.service with other attributes in OTel spans.

- Process-Agent: Improved parsing performance of the '/proc/pid/stat' file (Linux only)

- [snmp_listener] Enable ``collect_topology`` by default.

- dbm: add SQL obfuscation options to give customer more control over how SQL is obfuscated and normalized.
  - ``RemoveSpaceBetweenParentheses`` - remove spaces between parentheses. This option is only valid when ``ObfuscationMode`` is ``obfuscate_and_normalize``.
  - ``KeepNull` - disable obfuscating null values with ?. This option is only valid when ``ObfuscationMode`` is "obfuscate_only" or ``obfuscate_and_normalize``.
  - ``KeepBoolean`` - disable obfuscating boolean values with ?. This option is only valid when ``ObfuscationMode`` is ``obfuscate_only`` or ``obfuscate_and_normalize``.
  - ``KeepPositionalParameter`` - disable obfuscating positional parameters with ?. This option is only valid when ``ObfuscationMode`` is ``obfuscate_only`` or ``obfuscate_and_normalize``.

- Add logic to support multiple tags created by a single label/annotaion. 
  For example, add the following config to extract tags for chart_name and app_chart_name. 
    podLabelsAsTags: 
      chart_name: chart_name, app_chart_name 
  Note: the format must be a comma-separated list of tags.

- The logs collection pipeline has been through a refactor to support 
  processing only the message content (instead of the whole raw message)
  in the journald and Windows events tailers.
  This feature is experimental and off by default since it changes how
  existing `log_processing_rules` behaves with journald and Windows events
  tailer.
  Note that it will be switched on by default in a future release of the Agent.
  A warning notifying about this is shown when the journald and Windows events
  tailers are used with some `log_processing_rules`.

- The Datadog agent container image is now using Ubuntu 23.10 mantic
  as the base image.

- The win32_event_log check now continuously collects and reports events instead of waiting for
  ``min_collection_interval`` to collect.
  ``min_collection_interval`` now controls how frequently the check attempts to reconnect
  when the event subscription is in an error state.


.. _Release Notes_7.50.0_Deprecation Notes:

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

- Installing the Agent on Windows Server versions lower than 2016 and client versions lower than 10 is now deprecated.

- The ``timeout`` option for the win32_event_log check is no longer applicable and can be removed. If the option
  is set, the check logs a deprecation warning and ignores the option.


.. _Release Notes_7.50.0_Security Notes:

Security Notes
--------------

- Fix ``CVE-2023-45283`` and ``CVE-2023-45284``

- Update OpenSSL from 3.0.11 to 3.0.12.
  This addresses CVE-2023-5363.


.. _Release Notes_7.50.0_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- On Windows, uninstalling the Agent should not fail if the Datadog Agent registry key is missing.

- APM: OTLP: Only extract DD container tags from resource attributes. Previously, container tags were also extracted from span attributes.

- APM: OTLP: Only add container tags in tag `_dd.tags.container`. Previously, container tags were also added as span tags.

- Resolved an issue in the containerd collector where the SBOM collection did not correctly attach RepoTags and RepoDigests to the SBOM payload.

- Add a workaround for a bug in a Windows API that can cause the Agent to
  crash when collecting forwarded events from the Windows Event Log.

- Resolve the issue with hostname resolution in the kube_apiserver provider when the useHostNetwork setting is enabled.

- Fix an issue that prevented process ID (PID) from being associated with containers in Live Container View when the Agent is deployed in AWS Fargate.

- APM: Fixed trace-agent not forwarding errors from remote configuration and reporting them all as 500s

- On Windows, the `SE_DACL_AUTO_INHERITED` flag is reset on `%PROJECTLOCATION%` during upgrades and uninstalls.

- Fixes a bug in the Windows NPM driver where NPM displays byte overcounts.

- For USM on Windows, fixes the problem where paths were being erroneously
  reported as truncated

- Fixes journald log's Seek function to be set at the beginning or end upon initialization.

- Fixed the cause of some crashes related to CPU instruction
  incompatibility happening under certain CPUs when making calls to
  the included libgmp library.

- [kubelet] The Kubelet client no longer fails to initialize when the parameter ``kubelet_tls_verify`` is set to ``false`` with a misconfigured root certificate authority.

- Fixes a bug where the process-agent process check command would fail to run 
  when language detection was enabled.

- Document query metrics `metric_prefix` parameter.

- Set the tag `dd.internal.resource:database_instance` to `host` instead of `host/cdb`.

- Switch to the new obfuscator where bugs such as getting an error when obfuscating `@!` and where comments on DMLs weren't being removed are fixed.

- Fixes wrong values in Oracle query metrics data. Extreme cases had inflated statistics and missing statements. The affected were pure DML and PL/SQL statements.

- Fix the bug that prevented Oracle DBM working properly on AWS RDS non-multitenant instances.

- Fix an issue that caused the win32_event_log check to not stop running when the rate of incoming event
  records was higher than the ``timeout`` option. The ``timeout`` option is now deprecated.

- The Windows Event Log tailer automatically recovers and is able to resume collecting
  events when a log provider is reinstalled, which sometimes happens during Windows updates.

.. _Release Notes_7.49.0:

7.49.0 / 6.49.0
======

.. _Release Notes_7.49.0_Prelude:

Prelude
-------

Release on: 2023-11-02

- Refer to the `7.49.0 tag on integrations-core <https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/AGENT_CHANGELOG.md#datadog-agent-version-7490>`_ for the list of changes on the core checks


.. _Release Notes_7.49.0_New Features:

New Features
------------

- Add --use-unconnected-udp-socket flag to agent snmp walk command.

- Add support for image pull metrics in the containerd check.

- Add kubelet stats.summary check (kubernetes_core.kubelet.*) to the Agent's core checks to replace the old kubernetes.kubelet check generated from Python.

- APM: [BETA] Adds `peer_tags` configuration to allow for more tags in APM stats that
  can add granularity and clarity to a `peer.service`. To set this config, use
  ``DD_APM_PEER_TAGs='["aws.s3.bucket", "db.instance", ...]`` or
  ``apm_config.peer_tags: ["aws.s3.bucket", "db.instance", ...]`` in datadog.yaml.
  Please note that ``DD_APM_PEER_SERVICE_AGGREGATION`` or ``apm_config.peer_service_aggregation`` must also be set to ``true``.

- Introduces new Windows crash detection check.  Upon initial check
  run, sends a DataDog event if it is determined that the machine has
  rebooted due to a system crash.

- Install the Aerospike integration on ARM platforms for Python 3

- CWS: Detect patterns in processes and files paths to improve
  accuracy of anomaly detections.

- Add Dynamic Instrumentation diagnostics proxy endpoint to the trace-agent http server.
  
  At present, diagnostics are forwarded through the debugger endpoint on the trace-agent server to logs.
  Since Dynamic Instrumentation also allows adding dynamic metrics and dynamic spans, we want to remove the
  dependency on logs for diagnostics - the new endpoint uploads diagnostic messages on a dedicated track.

- Adds a configurable jmxfetch telemetry check that collects additional data on the
  running jmxfetch JVM in addition to data about the JVMs jmxfetch is monitoring.
  The check can be configured by enabling the jmx_telemetry_enabled option in the Agent.

- [NDM] Collect diagnoses from SNMP devices.

- Adding support for Oracle 12.2.

- Add support for Oracle 18c.

- CWS now computes hashes for all the files involved in the generation of a Security Profile and an Anomaly Detection Event

- [Beta] Cluster agent supports APM Single Step Instrumentation for Kubernetes.
  Can be enabled in Kubernetes cluster by setting ``DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true`.
  Single Step Instrumentation can be turned on in specific namespaces using 
  environment variable DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED_NAMESPACES.
  Single Step Instrumentation can be turned off in specific namespaces using 
  environment variable DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_DISABLED_NAMESPACES.


.. _Release Notes_7.49.0_Enhancement Notes:

Enhancement Notes
-----------------

- Moving the Orchestrator Explorer pod check from the process agent to the core agent. In the following release we will be removing the process agent check and defaulting to the core agent check. If you want to migrate ahead of time you can set ``orchestrator_explorer.run_on_node_agent`` = true in your configuration.

- Add new GPU metrics in the KSM Core check:
    - ``kubernetes_state.node.gpu_capacity`` tagged by ``node``, ``resource``, ``unit`` and ``mig_profile``.
    - ``kubernetes_state.node.gpu_allocatable`` tagged by ``node``, ``resource``, ``unit`` and ``mig_profile``.
    - ``kubernetes_state.container.gpu_limit`` tagged by kube_namespace, pod_name, kube_container_name, ``node``, ``resource``, ``unit`` and ``mig_profile``.

- Tag container entity with ``image_id`` tag.

- ``max_message_size_bytes`` can now be configured in ``logs_config``. This allows the default message
  content limit of 256,000 bytes to be increased up to 1MB. If a log line is larger than this byte limit,
  the overflow bytes will be truncated.

- APM: Add regex support for filtering tags by apm_config.filter_tags_regex or environment
  variables DD_APM_FILTER_TAGS_REGEX_REQUIRE and DD_APM_FILTER_TAGS_REGEX_REJECT.

- Agents are now built with Go ``1.20.10``.

- CWS: Support fentry/fexit eBPF probes which provide lower overhead than
  kprobe/kretprobes (currently disabled by default and supported only
  on Linux kernel 5.10 and later).

- CWS: Improved username resolution in containers and handle their creation
  and deletion at runtime.

- CWS: Apply policy rules on processes already present at startup.

- CWS: Reduce memory usage of BTF symbols.

- Remote Configuration for Cloud Workload Security detection rules is enabled if Remote Configuration is globally enabled for the Datadog Agent.
  Remote Configuration for Cloud Workload Security can be disabled while Remote Configuration is globally enabled by setting the `runtime_security_config.remote_configuration.enabled` value to false.
  Remote Configuration for Cloud Workload Security cannot be enabled if Remote Configuration is not globally enabled.

- Add ``gce-container-declaration`` to default GCE excluded host tags. See ``exclude_gce_tags`` configuration settings for more.

- Add metrics for the workloadmeta extractor to process-agent status output

- Add a heartbeat mechanism for SBOM collection to avoid having to
  send the whole SBOM if it has not changed since the last computation.
  The default interval for the host SBOM has changed from 24 hours to 1 hour.

- Prefix every entry in the log file with details about the database server and port to distinguish log entries originating from different databases.

- JMXFetch internal telemetry is now included in the ``agent status`` output when
  the verbose flag is included in the request.

- Sensitive information is now scrubbed from pod annotations.

- The image_id tag no longer includes the ``docker-pullable://`` prefix when using Kubernetes with Docker as runtime.

- Improve SQL text collection for self-managed installations. The Agent selects text from `V$SQL` instead of `V$SQLSTATS`. If it isn't possible to query the text, the Agent tries to identify the context, such as parsing or closing cursor, and put it in the SQL text.

- Improve the Oracle check example configuration file.

- Collect Oracle execution plans by default.

- Add global custom queries to Oracle checks.

- Add connection refused handling.

- Add the `hosting-type` tag, which can have one of the following values: `self-managed`, `RDS`, or `OCI`.

- Add a hidden parameter to log unobfuscated execution plan information.

- Adding `real_hostname` tag.

- Add `sql_id` and `plan_hash_value` to obfuscation error message.

- Add Oracle ``pga_over_allocation_count_metric``.

- Add information about missing privileges with the link to the `grant` commands.

- Add TCPS configuration to `conf.yaml.example`.

- The `container` check reports two new metrics:
  
    * ``container.memory.page_faults``
    * ``container.memory.major_page_faults``
  
    to report the page fault counters per container.

- prometheus_scrape: Adds support for multiple OpenMetrics V2 features in the ``prometheus_scrape.checks[].configurations[]`` items:
    * ``exclude_metrics_by_labels``
    * ``raw_line_filters``
    * ``cache_shared_labels``
    * ``use_process_start_time``
    * ``hostname_label``
    * ``hostname_format``
    * ``telemetry``
    * ``ignore_connection_errors``
    * ``request_size``
    * ``log_requests``
    * ``persist_connections``
    * ``allow_redirects``
    * ``auth_token``
  For a description of each option, refer to the sample configuration in https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/openmetrics/datadog_checks/openmetrics/data/conf.yaml.example.

- Improved the SBOM check function to now communicate the status of scans and any potential errors directly 
  to DataDog for more streamlined error management and resolution.

- Separate `init-containers` from `containers` in the `KubernetesPod` structure of workloadmeta.

- Improve marshalling performance in the ``system-probe`` -> ``process-agent`` path. This improves memory footprint when NPM and/or USM are enabled.

- Raise the default ``logs_config.open_files_limit`` to ``500`` on 
  Windows.


.. _Release Notes_7.49.0_Deprecation Notes:

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

- `service_monitoring_config.enable_go_tls_support` is deprecated and replaced by `service_monitoring_config.tls.go.enabled`.
  `network_config.enable_https_monitoring` is deprecated and replaced by `service_monitoring_config.tls.native.enabled`.


.. _Release Notes_7.49.0_Security Notes:

Security Notes
--------------

- APM: The Agent now obfuscates the entire Memcached command by
  default. You can revert to the previous behavior where only the values
  were obfuscated by setting ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_MEMCACHED_KEEP_COMMAND=true``
  or ``apm_config.obfuscation.memcached.keep_command: true`` in datadog.yaml. 

- Fix ``CVE-2023-39325``

- Bump ``golang.org/x/net`` to v0.17.0 to fix CVE-2023-44487.


.. _Release Notes_7.49.0_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix Agent Flare not including Trace Agent's expvar output.

- Fixes a panic that occurs when the Trace Agent receives an OTLP payload during shutdown

- Fixes a crash upon receiving an OTLP Exponential Histogram with no buckets.

- CWS: Scope network context to DNS events only as it may not be available
  to all events.

- CWS: Fix a bug that caused security profiles of already running workloads
  to be empty.

- The ``docker.cpu.shares`` metric emitted by the Docker check now reports the correct number of CPU shares when running on cgroups v2.

- Fixes a critical data race in ``workloadmeta`` that was causing issues when a subscriber attempted to unsubscribe while events were being handled in another goroutine.

- Fix misnamed metric in the trace-agent.

- Fixed a problem that caused the Agent to miss some image labels when using
  ``containerd`` as the container runtime.

- Fix config conflict preventing ``logs_config.use_podman_logs`` from working

- The scubbing logic for configurations now scrubs YAML lists. This fixes ``flare_stripped_keys`` not working on YAML
  list.

- Fixed an issue in the SBOM check when using Kubernetes with Docker as runtime. Some images used by containers were incorrectly marked as unused.

- Fix Oracle SQL text truncation in query samples.

- Make the custom queries feature available for non-DBM users.

- Fix wrong tags generated by custom queries.

- Eliminate duplicate upper case ``cdb`` and ``pdb`` tags.

- Fix `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` in `StatementMetrics` by improving cache handling.

- Fix truncation of SQL text for large statements.

- Fix the `failed to query v$pdbs`, which was appearing for RDS databases.

- Bug fix for `ORA-06502: PL/SQL: numeric or value error: character string buffer too small`. This error would occasionally appear during activity sampling.

- Adjust doc links to grant privilege commands for multitenant and non-CDB architecture.

- Workaround for the PGA memory leak.

- Improve recovering from lost connections in custom queries.

- Emit zero value for oracle.pga_over_allocation metric.

.. _Release Notes_7.48.1_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- On some slow drives, when the Agent shuts down suddenly the Logs Agent registry file can become corrupt.
  This means that when the Agent starts again the registry file can't be read and therefore the Logs Agent reads logs from the beginning again.
  With this update, the Agent now attempts to update the registry file atomically to reduce the chances of a corrupted file.

.. _Release Notes_7.48.0_Upgrade Notes:

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- The EventIDs logged to the Windows Application Event Log by the Agent services
  have been normalized and now have the same meaning across Agent services.
  Some EventIDs have changed and the rendered message may be incorrect
  if you view an Event Log from a host that uses a different version of the Agent
  than the host that created the Event Log. To ensure you see the correct message,
